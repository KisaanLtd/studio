# **App Name**: AgriMatch Connect

## Core Features:

- User Registration: Allow farmers, coordinators, and buyers to register and create profiles.
- Profile Management: Enable users to create and manage their profiles, including crop information, location, and other relevant details.
- AI-Powered Matchmaking: Implement an AI-driven matching engine that suggests connections between farmers and buyers based on crop type, location, quantity, timing, and certifications. This matching engine is a tool.
- Match Display and Filtering: Present the user with a list of prospective parties (producers, purchasers) generated by the AI, as well as functionality to allow them to refine results further based on the available selection criteria.
- Lead Management Workflow: Enable farmers to request introductions to matched buyers, creating a lead for the coordinator to manage.
- Coordinator Dashboard: Provide coordinators with a dashboard to manage leads, contact buyers, and track deal progress.
- Lead Status Tracking: Allow farmers to track the status of their leads as they move through the workflow (New, Contacted, Negotiating, Closed/Lost).
